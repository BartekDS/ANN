# Classification of parking spaces
In this repository i would love to present my classification of free and occupied parking spaces. The data set was made by me and my brother from drone at an altitude of 65 meters. The neural network i chose for classification is AlexNet.
Stack of this work is Numpy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Pytorch.
I performed data augmentation by copying each image after rotation by 90, 180 and 270 degrees.
